# <div align="center"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alan Romano</div>

I'm a recent doctoral graduate from the University of Southern California. My research is in software engineering, and I specialize in using program analysis to aid in WebAssembly (WASM) development, testing, and debugging. You can find some of my research projects on GitHub, including:
- [WASim](https://github.com/WASimilarity/WASim)
- [MinerRay](https://github.com/miner-ray/miner-ray.github.io)
- [Our Wasm Compiler Bug Study](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io)
- [Our UI Flaky Test Study](https://github.com/ui-flaky-test/ui-flaky-test.github.io)

I also love all things web and am skilled in many web languages and technologies, namely:
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- React
- Angular
- HTML/CSS

Let's work together on using WebAssembly to speed up the web!
